# Task Manager with Microservices

This project is a task management system built with a microservices architecture using .NET 6, Docker, and Kubernetes. The system is designed to demonstrate the power of microservices, DevOps practices, and containerization. It includes multiple services such as authentication, task management, notifications, and report generation, each running in its own Docker container and orchestrated using Kubernetes.

Technologies Used:
	•	.NET: For building RESTful APIs in each microservice.
	•	Docker: For containerizing services and running them in isolated environments.
	•	Kubernetes: For orchestration and scaling the microservices.
	•	Kafka (optional): For inter-service communication (to be added in future iterations).
	•	CI/CD with GitHub Actions: For automated builds and deployments.

Features:
	•	Scalable microservices architecture.
	•	Services: Authentication, Task Management, Notifications, and Reports.
	•	Dockerized services for easy deployment.
	•	Kubernetes configuration for deployment in cloud or on-premise clusters.
	•	CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.

Getting Started:

To get started with the project, you can clone this repository and use Docker Compose to run the services locally or deploy them to a Kubernetes cluster.
